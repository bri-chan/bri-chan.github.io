- As a full-time student, I tried thinking of a way to eliminate distractions and stay motivated by making studying more fun. I combined a Pomodoro timer with something students all love -- boba -- and made a web app out of it!
- ProductiviTEA is a web app that merges the Pomodoro technique and milk tea cafe experience to create a fun study session for high school students and young adults. The Pomodoro method is a way to focus on a task by working in intervals, consisting of long periods of work and small breaks in between.
